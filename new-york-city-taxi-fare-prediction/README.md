## New York City Taxi Fare Prediction
### Can you predict a rider's taxi fare?
<br>
This is one of the Kaggle Competition for biginner and it was alredy completed.<br>
Even it is very simple and straitforward for estimation, I thought it will be a good example to practice estimation problem from the scrath. <br>

You can refer to here for details, https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction <br>
The original train.csv file which is pretty large, it's a about 5.5GB that has 55M rows <br>
so you may encounter some trobules when running your codes on your local machine (or google colab)

Here is smaller version of train.csv file which samples 10% of orginal file.<br>
You can download here

There are two files
 - NewYork_City_Taxi_Fare_Prediction_tf.ipynb
 - NewYork_City_Taxi_Fare_Prediction.ipynb
 
The first one is the tensorflow code which I made for your reference. 
It's not optimized yet. Your task is to create PyTorch code and run your own code and compare it with other competitions.<br>

PyTorch code is **NewYork_City_Taxi_Fare_Prediction.ipynb**, please fill in your code.
